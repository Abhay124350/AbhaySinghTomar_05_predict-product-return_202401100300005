This project uses machine learning to predict whether a product will be returned based on features like purchase amount, delivery time, and review score. The model helps e-commerce platforms reduce return rates and improve customer satisfaction.
üîç Algorithm Used
The model employs the Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to provide robust and accurate predictions. The Random Forest algorithm is particularly effective for this kind of classification task, as it can handle both categorical and numerical data efficiently, and it is resistant to overfitting.

Key Features:
Ensemble Method: Combines multiple decision trees to improve model accuracy.

Robust to Overfitting: Especially useful for large datasets with many features.

Handles Missing Data: Capable of working well even when some data is missing or incomplete.
